# Plotly-Challenge
Module 12- Plotly Challenge
## Purpose of this project:
Our client Roza has a partially completed dashboard that she needs to finish. She has a completed panel for demographic information and now needs to visualize the bacterial data for each volunteer. Specifically, her volunteers should be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. That way, if Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, Roza's volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.
## Skills used:
### Deliverable 1:
We need to us our recently gained knowledge of JavaScript, Plotly, and D3.js, create a horizontal bar chart to display the top 10 bacterial species (OTUs) when an individual’s ID is selected from the dropdown menu on the webpage. The horizontal bar chart will display the sample_values as the values, the otu_ids as the labels, and the otu_labels as the hover text for the bars on the chart. Here is how our graph looks:

### Deliverable 2:
Using your knowledge of JavaScript, Plotly, and D3.js, create a bubble chart that will display the following when an individual’s ID is selected from the dropdown menu webpage:
   * The otu_ids as the x-axis values.
   * The sample_values as the y-axis values.
   * The sample_values as the marker size.
   * The otu_ids as the marker colors.
   * The otu_labels as the hover-text values.
Our bubble chart look like the following image:

### Deliverable 3:
Using your knowledge of JavaScript, Plotly, and D3.js, create a gauge chart that displays the weekly washing frequency's value, and display the value as a measure from 0-10 on the progress bar in the gauge chart when an individual ID is selected from the dropdown menu.

Our gauge chart look similar to the following image:

### Deliverable 4:
We have to use our knowledge of HTML and Bootstrap to customize the webpage for your dashboard.
1. Customize your dashboard with three of the following:
      * Add an image to the jumbotron.(Shows the image in the background.)
      * Add background color or a variety of compatible colors to the webpage.(yes, this is done)
      * Use a custom font with contrast for the colors.(yes, we did this too)
      * Add more information about the project as a paragraph on the page. (Added the credit and info paragraph on the page with my name.)
      * Add information about what each graph visualizes, either under or next to each graph. 
      * Make the webpage mobile-responsive.
      * Change the layout of the page.
      * Add a navigation bar that allows you to select the bar or bubble chart on the page.
2. When the dashboard is first opened in a browser, ID 940’s data should be displayed in the dashboard, and the three charts should be working according to their  requirements.( We fulfilled this condition.)
3. When a sample is selected, the dashboard should display the data in the panel and all three charts according to their requirements.(This condition is also fulfilled.)
